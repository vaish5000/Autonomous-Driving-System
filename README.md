# Autonomous-Driving-System
The idea is for building a simulated version of self-driving car in a 3D environment. Here, we will first drive the car manually and gather the front, right and left camera view of a simulated car along with the steering angle, throttle and break information. This data will train the CNN model on the computer which will then predict the steering angle, throttle and break of the unknown images, to make the car drive by itself.
