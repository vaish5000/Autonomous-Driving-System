# Autonomous-Driving-System
An autonomous driving car simulation with the help of CNN model.
## About the project
The project is about building a simulated version of self-driving car in a 3D environment. Here, we will first drive the car manually and gather the front, right and left camera view of a simulated car. We would also record the steering angle, throttle and break information. This data will be fed through the Convolutional Neural Network and the label will be the focal point for the images. Then the CNN model on the computer will learn the steering angle from the training data and will eventually predict the steering angle throttle and break of the unknown images, to make the car drive by itself and avoid all kinds of collisions/deviations from the track.
